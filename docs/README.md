**Flexible search!**
- The search is case-insensitive and matches partial words.
- The `find` command will show all task that match at least 3 characters of your keyword, i.e. finding CON will return conan.

## Saving data
Task data is saved internally in the appâ€™s directory only upon exit.
So closing the window mid-execution will discard all changes.
The task data is loaded from the internal storage when starting the app.
